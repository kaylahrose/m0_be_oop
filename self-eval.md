# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- It felt extremely uncomfortable and stressful, I had to rely on peers to complete it.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- My workflow is going pretty well actually. I'm able to identify unproductive struggles and take breaks when needed.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
- I need to get more sleep.
